        <h3>Grooming</h3>

        <p>Our grooming appointments can take anywhere from 2-4 hours, depending on your pet’s size, coat type and the services you choose.

          <div>1. Hands-On Pet Assessment: 5-10 Minutes</div>
          
          <div>One of our safety-certified salon associates will do an assessment of your pet’s skin, coat, ears, nails and teeth, so they can properly address their unique needs. While our stylists do take note of any behavioral or health concerns, this is a great time to let us know of any additional concerns, preferences or individual requirements.</div>
          
          <div>2. Brushing & Clipping (pre-bath steps): 10-30 minutes</div>
          
          <div>Your Pet Stylist will start by brushing, combing and clipping your pet to remove any excess hair or tangles before they get their bath. They will also trim the pet’s nails and clean their ears.</div>
          
          <div>3. Relaxing Bath: 10-30 minutes</div>
          
          <div>Our relaxing bath system makes tub time a pampering experience. Your salon expert will start by washing your pet with the shampoo/conditioner you agreed on at check-in. All the shampoos and conditioners we use are pH-balanced specifically for pets and provide gentle cleansing without drying your pet’s skin.</div>
          
          <div>4. Custom Drying: 30 minutes+</div>
          
          <div>The drying process begins with a gentle towel drying on your pet’s face, ears and tail. Our dryers are not heated and have adjustable speeds. Different breeds have different needs and each pet is carefully dried using the best method for safety and comfort.</div>
          
          <div>5. Tailored Haircut & Finishing Touches: 30 minutes+</div>
          
          <div>Completing your pet’s haircut after they have been washed and blow-dried allows your stylist to ensure there are no additional tangles and provides the best-looking haircut. If your pet only received a bath or de-shedding service, this time will be used to complete their brush-out, touch-up their nails, wipe out their ears & complete all the finishing touches to get them ready for pickup.</div></p>
